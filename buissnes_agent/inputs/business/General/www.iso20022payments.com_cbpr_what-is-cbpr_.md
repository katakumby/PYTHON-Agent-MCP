## What is CBPR+?

Welcome to the CBPR+ section of my website!

But, what is CBPR+?

In a nutshell, **Cross-Border Payments and Reporting Plus (CBPR+)** is a market group that prepares the documentation for SWIFT cross-border payments migration to ISO 20022. So, the work of CBPR+ is strictly related to the SWIFT ISO 20022 adoption program.

You can learn about this SWIFT initiative [here](https://www.swift.com/standards/iso-20022/iso-20022-programme "SWIFT ISO 20022").

This is important as generally ISO 20022 messages may be exchanged via various Network Service Providers. However, in the context of CBPR+ migration, we are talking about SWIFT initiative and the payments processed via SWIFT network.

As we can see from the CBPR+ name, this migration is related to cross-border payments. The topic of cross-border payments is very complex.

As I think it is important to remind us of the most important aspects related to cross-border payments before we dive deep into the message analysis, I prepared on the following page the summary of key elements of [cross-border payments](https://iso20022payments.com/cbpr/cross-border-payments/).

Additionally, if you want to position CBPR+ in the context of other groups you may visit these two sections:

- [ISO 20022 market implementations](https://www.iso20022payments.com/miscellaneous/iso-20022-market-implementations/)
